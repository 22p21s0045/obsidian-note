Frameworks support organizations’ ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations. For example, the healthcare industry uses frameworks to comply with the United States’ Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires that medical professionals keep patient information safe.

# OWASP
- **Minimize attack surface area**: Attack surface refers to all the potential vulnerabilities a threat actor could exploit.
    
- **Principle of least privilege**: Users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks.
    
- **Defense in depth**: Organizations should have varying security controls that mitigate risks and threats.
    
- **Separation of duties**: Critical actions should rely on<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> multiple people</mark>, each of whom follow the principle of least privilege. 
    
- **Keep security simple**: Avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult. 
    
- **Fix security issues correctly**: When security incidents occur, identify the root cause, contain the impact, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure that remediation is successful.
