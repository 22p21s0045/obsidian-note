## Goal of testing
- Determine correctness, under certain assumptions/conditions
- Find faults and failures << to fix
- Static test << review code (code not running)
- Dynamic test << test running software
- Pass/ fail criteria are determined by stakeholders << test results

## Software Assurance

1. **Security and Reliability**:
    
    - Ensuring that software is secure, reliable, and free from vulnerabilities.
    - Addressing potential risks related to security breaches, data leaks, and unauthorized access.
2. **Quality and Compliance**:
    
    - Verifying that software adheres to quality standards and industry best practices.
    - Meeting compliance requirements (such as legal, regulatory, or organizational standards).
3. **Lifecycle Management**:
    
    - Managing software throughout its entire lifecycle, from design and development to maintenance and retirement.
    - Regularly assessing and improving software to maintain its integrity.

### Verification vs Validation

**Verification**:

- Focuses on checking if the software is built correctly according to specifications.
- Involves static testing of documents, design, code, and programs.
- Aims to identify and correct defects early in the development process.
- Ensures that the software conforms to requirements and standards.

**Validation**:

- Focuses on confirming that the software meets stakeholder needs and expectations.
- Involves dynamic testing through activities like testing, reviews, and user feedback.
- Aims to ensure that the software is the right product that satisfies user requirements.
- Validates that the software functions as intended and provides value to users.
