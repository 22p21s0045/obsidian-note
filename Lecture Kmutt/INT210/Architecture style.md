# SOA architecture

SOA simplifies complex software systems into<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> reusable services</mark> that can be accessed by other applications and users referred to as service consumers. These services can be used as building blocks of new applications. Each SOA service has a specific task and an interface that includes the service's input and output parameters as well as the communication protocol required to access it.

**Advantages:**

- **Increased Reusability:** Services can be reused across different applications, reducing development effort and time.
- **Improved Agility:** SOA allows for easier integration with new technologies and rapid adaptation to changing business needs.
- **Enhanced Scalability:** Services can be independently scaled to meet increased demands.
- **Standardized Communication:** Defined service interfaces facilitate interoperability between different systems and platforms.
- **Loose Coupling:** Services are independent, leading to increased flexibility and improved maintainability.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Increased Complexity:** Designing and managing complex service interactions can be challenging, requiring careful planning and expertise.
- **Security Concerns:** Secure service communication and data access require careful consideration and implementation of appropriate security measures.
- **Testing Challenges:** Testing and debugging service interactions can be complex compared to tightly coupled systems.

- อาาจะต้องเเปะ service อะไรไปบางอย่างตลอด เช่น monitoring
- service plane เป็นระบบที่จะควบคุมส่วน monitoring ใน node ต่างๆ
