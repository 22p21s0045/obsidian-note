## Security component
- end to end
“End-to-end security” refers to a comprehensive approach to protecting data, communications, and operations across an entire system or network. It involves implementing security measures at <mark class="hltr-yellow">every stage</mark>, from the initial data creation or collection point to its final destination. [This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential, maintains its integrity, and is available to authorized users when needed](https://www.kiteworks.com/secure-email/secure-email-end-to-end-security/)[1](https://www.kiteworks.com/secure-email/secure-email-end-to-end-security/)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/end-to-end).

## INFORMATION (VISUALIZATION) ERA
- Information needs to be hidden from unauthorized access
- Protect from unauthorized
- authorized entity when it is needed

## Priority of trust device

## Denial of service (Dos)
- ถูกโจมตีจนต้องหยุดให้บริการ

## Intranet risk (ความเสี่ยงภายใน)
- **Intercepting Network Messages (ดักจับ)**: This is commonly known as **sniffing**. It involves capturing network traffic, which can include sensitive information like user IDs, passwords, and financial data. Encryption and secure communication protocols are essential to protect against this.

- **Accessing Corporate Databases**: When employees have connections to central databases, there’s a risk that sensitive data could be accessed improperly. Implementing strict access controls and monitoring can help mitigate this risk.

- **Privileged Employees (สิทธิพิเศษ)**: Employees with override privileges can potentially access mission-critical data without authorization. The principle of least privilege, where users have only the access necessary for their job, can help prevent abuse.

- **Reluctance to Prosecute (ความลังเลใจ ในการเอาผิด/ดําเนินคดี)**: Sometimes organizations may hesitate to take legal action against cybercrimes due to fear of negative publicity. However, this can embolden criminals. It’s important for organizations to have clear policies and take decisive action against security breaches to deter criminal behavior

## Dictionary attack
A dictionary attack is a type of cyber attack that involves systematically entering words from a list, such as those found in a dictionary, as passwords to gain unauthorized access to a system, account, or encrypted file. Attackers use extensive lists of the most commonly used passwords, popular pet names, fictional characters, or literally just words from a dictionary.
