## SNMP
SNMP is a protocol used for **network management** to monitor network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative attention.

- SNMP is like a set of **standardized question**s a teacher (NMS) can ask the students to get information about their progress (device status).
- The teacher then collects these answers, analyzes them, identifies any students who might be struggling, and takes necessary actions.
- MIB acts like a **dictionary** for network devices. It defines the data available on the device, what each piece of data represents (e.g., CPU temperature, memory usage, interface errors), and how it's organized.
