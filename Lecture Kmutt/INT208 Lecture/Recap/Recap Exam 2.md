## Symetric key
A symmetric key cipher is a cryptographic system that uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption processes. This means that the **same key** is used to convert plaintext into ciphertext during encryption and to convert the ciphertext back into plaintext during decryption. Symmetric key ciphers are widely used for their speed and efficiency, as they generally operate faster than asymmetric key ciphers, also known as public-key cryptography

## Asymetric key
Asymmetric key cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, utilizes a pair of mathematically linked keys: **a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption**. The public key is shared openly, while the private key is kept confidential. Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key. This cryptographic system provides secure communication and digital signatures, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity

## SNMP
 stands for Simple Network Management Protocol, and it is a protocol used for **managing and monitoring network-connected devices** in Internet Protocol (IP) networks[1](https://www.auvik.com/franklyit/blog/network-basics-what-is-snmp/)[2](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/SNMP)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol)[4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/)[5](https://www.thousandeyes.com/learning/techtorials/snmp-simple-network-management-protocol).Â SNMP is used to collect and organize information about managed devices on IP networks, enabling network administrators to monitor and manage network performance, identify devices, track changes, and deliver real-time status updates. SNMP uses a client-server model, with servers called managers and clients called agents.
