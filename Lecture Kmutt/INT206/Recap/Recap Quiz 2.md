## Back up and Recovery

**Backup**
	- Logfile is **circular fix size**
	- Datafile
- Process of periodically taking a copy of the database and log file (and possiblâ€¢:
programs) to offline storage media (disk or tape).
**Journaling / logfile**
- Process of keeping and maintaining a log file (or journal) of all changes made
to database to enable effective recovery in event Of failure.


## Backup Concepts
- What data need to be backed up?
- Location of systems and files to be backed up?
- Who performs backups?
- Time frames for backups?

## Physical Backup
Physical backups consist of<mark class="hltr-yellow"> raw copies </mark>of the directories and files that
store database contents. This type of backup is suitable for large, important
databases that need to be recovered quickly when problems occur.

## Logical Backup
Save information with type SQL script
