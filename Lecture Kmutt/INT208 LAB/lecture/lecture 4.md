## SNMP 
stands for Simple Network Management Protocol. It's a widely used protocol for managing and **monitoring network** devices and systems. SNMP is designed to facilitate the exchange of management information between network devices, such as routers, switches, servers, printers, and more, enabling administrators to monitor network performance, troubleshoot issues, and manage network configurations.

## MIB (Management Information Base)
The MIB is a database that **describes the structure of management data** of a device being managed by SNMP. It's essentially a collection of managed objects that are organized hierarchically.
