@Autowired is an annotation used in Spring Boot to enable <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">automatic dependency </mark>injection. It allows the Spring container to provide an instance of a required dependency when a bean is created. This annotation can be used on fields, constructors, and methods to have Spring provide the dependencies automatically. Dependency injection is a design pattern in which objects are passed their dependencies rather than creating them internally. In Spring Boot, **`@Autowired`** is used to inject objects into other objects. This allows for loose coupling between components and helps to keep code more maintainable.
