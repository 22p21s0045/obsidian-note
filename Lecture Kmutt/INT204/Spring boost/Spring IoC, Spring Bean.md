Spring IoC is the mechanism to achieve loose-coupling between Objects dependencies. To achieve loose coupling and dynamic binding of the objects at runtime, objects dependencies are injected by other assembler objects. Spring IoC container is the program that **injects** dependencies into an object and make it ready for our use. We have already looked how we can use [Spring Dependency Injection](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/spring-dependency-injection "Spring Dependency Injection Example with Annotations and XML Configuration") to implement IoC in our applications. Spring IoC container classes are part of `org.springframework.beans` and `org.springframework.context` packages. Spring IoC container provides us different ways to decouple the object dependencies. `BeanFactory` is the root interface of Spring IoC container. `ApplicationContext` is the child interface of `BeanFactory` interface that provide Spring AOP features, i18n etc. Some of the useful child-interfaces of `ApplicationContext` are `ConfigurableApplicationContext` and `WebApplicationContext`. Spring Framework provides a number of useful ApplicationContext implementation classes that we can use to get the spring context and then the Spring Bean. Some of the useful ApplicationContext implementations th
