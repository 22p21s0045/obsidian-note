**Think of a POJO as a basic information container.**

- **Like a backpack:** Your backpack might hold books, snacks, and pencils. A POJO is similar, but it holds pieces of information about something.
    
- **Each pocket is a variable:** In your backpack, you have different pockets to organize things. In a POJO, you have variables (like little storage compartments) to store specific information. For example:
    
    - `name` variable to store someone's name.
    - `age` variable to store their age.
    - `favoriteColor` variable to store their favorite color, etc.
