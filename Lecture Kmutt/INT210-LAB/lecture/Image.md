It serves as a <span style="background:#fff88f">blueprint for creating Docker containers,</span> providing instructions on how a container should be instantiated, including which software components will run and how. Docker images are lightweight, portable, and platform-independent, allowing applications to run consistently across different computing environments

	Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker that serves as the world's largest repository of container images. It acts as a container registry where developers can find, use, and share container images. Docker Hub hosts a wide array of content sources, including container community developers, open source projects, and independent software vendors (ISVs) who build and distribute their code in containers. Users can push and pull container images, automatically build images from GitHub and Bitbucket, trigger actions
