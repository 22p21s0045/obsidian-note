**Security controls** are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">safeguards</mark> designed to reduce _specific_ security risks. Security controls are the measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy. For example, a control that can be used alongside frameworks to ensure a hospital remains compliant with HIPAA is requiring that patients use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access their medical records. Using a measure like MFA to validate someoneâ€™s identity is one way to help mitigate potential risks and threats to private data.
