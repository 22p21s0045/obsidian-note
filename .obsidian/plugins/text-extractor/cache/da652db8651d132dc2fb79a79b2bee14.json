If the output is written on the client side, the server must also send it to the backup program. « Output is larger than for physical backup, particularly when saved in text format. Y + Backup and restore granularity is available at the server level (all databases), database level (all tables in a particular database), or table level. This is true regardless of storage engine. * The backup does not include log or configuration files, or other database-related files that are not part of databases. + Backups stored in logical format are machine independent and highly portable. « Logical backups are performed with the MySQL server running. The server is not taken offline. « Logical backup tools include the mysqldump program and the SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE statement. These work for any storage engine, even MEMORY. + To restore logical backups, SQL-format dump files can be processed using the mysql client. To load delimited-text files, use the LOAD DATA statement or the mysglimport client.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":"eng"}
