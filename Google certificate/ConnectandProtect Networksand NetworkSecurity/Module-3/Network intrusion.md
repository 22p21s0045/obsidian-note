## What is the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)?

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a [network layer](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-the-network-layer/) protocol used by network devices to <mark class="hltr-yellow">diagnose network communication issues</mark>. ICMP is mainly used to determine whether or not data is reaching its intended destination in a timely manner. Commonly, the ICMP [protocol](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-protocol/) is used on network devices, such as [routers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-router/). ICMP is crucial for error reporting and testing, but it can also be used in [distributed d](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/)


## ICMP Flood
- Attacker repeatedly sending ICMP package to server
