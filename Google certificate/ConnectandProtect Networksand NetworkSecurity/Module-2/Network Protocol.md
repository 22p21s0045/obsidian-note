#protocol 
A rule use by two or more device to describe order of delivery and structure of data
#tips 
TCP is an internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data.

#arp 
## ARP (Address resolution protocol)
- translate IP address to MAC address
#https
## Https (Hyper text transfer protocol)
- Provide a secre method of communication
#DNS
## DNS (Domain name system)
- Change domain name to ip address
#SNMP #protocol 
## Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
- is a network protocol used for monitoring and managing devices on a network. SNMP can reset a password on a network device or change its baseline configuration. It can also send requests to network devices for a report on how much of the networkâ€™s bandwidth is being used up. In the TCP/IP model, SNMP occurs at the application layer.
#DHCP
## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
the management family of network protocols. DHCP is an application layer protocol used on a network to configure devices.
# Security protocols
- HTTPS
- SSL/TLS
