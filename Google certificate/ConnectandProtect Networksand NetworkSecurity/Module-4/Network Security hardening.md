## Intrusion Detection System
An **intrusion detection system** (IDS) is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. An IDS alerts administrators based on the signature of malicious traffic.

1. **Identity Access Management (IAM):** IAM tools and processes are crucial for managing digital identities and authorizing user access to cloud resources. Misconfigurations of user roles can lead to unauthorized access, increasing security risks.
    
2. **Configuration Management:** Proper configuration of cloud services is essential to meet security and compliance requirements. Migrating processes to the cloud requires meticulous configuration to avoid leaving the network vulnerable to compromise. Misconfigured cloud services are a common source of security issues.
    
3. **Attack Surface:** Cloud service providers offer a wide range of applications and services, increasing an organization's attack surface. However, a well-designed network can mitigate this risk by implementing proper security measures. Misuse of entry points into the network can introduce malware and other vulnerabilities.
    
4. **Zero-Day Attacks:** Zero-day attacks, previously unknown exploits, are a concern for both cloud and on-premise networks. Cloud service providers are often quicker to detect and respond to such attacks, but organizations must also implement their own patching and mitigation strategies.
    
5. **Visibility and Tracking:** Cloud networks offer visibility through tools like flow logs and packet mirroring, but organizations may have limited access compared to on-premise networks. Third-party audits can help identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance.
    
6. **Cloud Service Updates:** Cloud service updates can impact security considerations, requiring organizations to adapt their IT processes accordingly. Organizations must stay abreast of changes made by cloud service providers and adjust their configurations and connections as needed.
    
7. **Shared Responsibility Model:** The shared responsibility model clarifies the responsibilities of both the cloud service provider and the organization using the cloud. While the provider is responsible for the security of the cloud infrastructure, the organization is accountable for securing their data and configurations within the cloud.
