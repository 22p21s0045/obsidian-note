## Brute force attack
brute force attacks, including simple brute force and dictionary attacks, exploit weak or easily guessable passwords to compromise system security. Organizations can mitigate the risk of these attacks by enforcing strong password policies, implementing multi-factor authentication, and employing intrusion detection systems to detect and block suspicious login attempts.

> - **Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and two-factor authentication (2FA):** MFA is a security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network. This verification happens using a combination of authentication factors: a username and password, fingerprints, facial recognition, or a one-time password (OTP) sent to a phone number or email. 2FA is similar to MFA, except it uses only two forms of verification.
