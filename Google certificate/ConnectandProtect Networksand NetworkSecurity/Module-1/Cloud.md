1. **Network Architecture**:
    
    - Networks consist of physical devices like workstations, servers, routers, and switches.
    - Local area networks (LANs) cover small geographical areas, while wide area networks (WANs) span larger regions.
    - Cloud networks utilize remote servers and services hosted on the internet.
2. **Cloud Computing**:
    
    - Cloud computing involves using remote servers and services instead of on-premise devices.
    - Cloud service providers (CSPs) own large data centers globally.
    - CSPs offer services like storage and compute through APIs or web consoles.
3. **CSP Services**:
    
    - **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Companies can use software suites remotely without hosting them.


## Benefits of cloud computing and software-defined networks

Three of the main reasons that cloud computing is so attractive to businesses are reliability, decreased cost, and increased scalability.

### Reliability

Reliability in cloud computing is based on how available cloud services and resources are, how secure connections are, and how often the services are effectively running. Cloud computing allows employees and customers to access the resources they need consistently and with minimal interruption.

### Cost

Traditionally, companies have had to provide their own network infrastructure, at least for internet connections. This meant there could be potentially significant upfront costs for companies. However, because CSPs have such large data centers, they are able to offer virtual devices and services at a fraction of the cost required for companies to install, patch, upgrade, and manage the components and software themselves.

### Scalability

Another challenge that companies face with traditional computing is scalability. When organizations experience an increase in their business needs, they might be forced to buy more equipment and software to keep up. But what if business decreases shortly after? They might no longer have the business to justify the cost incurred by the upgraded components. CSPs reduce this risk by making it easy to consume services in an elastic utility model as needed. This means that companies only pay for what they need when they need it.
