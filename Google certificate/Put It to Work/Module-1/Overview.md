### Summary: Data and Asset Classification

**Key Data Classification Types:**

1. **Public Data**:
    
    - Accessible to the public with minimal risk.
    - Examples: Press releases, job descriptions, marketing materials.
    - Requires basic protection from security attacks.
2. **Private Data**:
    
    - Should be kept from the public to prevent serious risks.
    - Examples: Company email addresses, employee ID numbers, research data.
    - Requires a higher level of security.
3. **Sensitive Data**:
    
    - Must be protected from unauthorized access due to significant potential damage.
    - Examples: PII (personally identifiable information), SPII (sensitive PII), PHI (protected health information), banking details, social security numbers, passwords, medical information.
    - Requires stringent security measures.
4. **Confidential Data**:
    
    - Crucial for business operations with limited access, often protected by NDAs.
    - Examples: Trade secrets, financial records, sensitive government data.
    - Requires the highest level of security.

**Asset Classification:**

- **Low-Level Assets**:
    
    - Public data is a low-level asset, posing minimal risk if compromised.
    - Example: Company website address.
- **High-Level Assets**:
    
    - Sensitive and confidential data are high-level assets due to the significant negative impact if leaked.
    - Examples: Internal emails discussing trade secrets, proprietary information.
