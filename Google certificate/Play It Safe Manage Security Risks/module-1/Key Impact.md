- Malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organization's data and demand a ransom to decrypt it.
- Can freeze network systems, render devices unusable, and lock confidential data.
- Decryption key is needed to regain access, similar to a password.
- Ransom negotiations and data leakages often occur through the dark web.

**The Deep Web and the Dark Web:**

- The web is made up of three layers: surface web, deep web, and dark web.
- **Surface web:** Most commonly used layer, accessible through web browsers.
- **Deep web:** Requires authorization, like an organization's intranet.
- **Dark web:** Requires special software, known for criminal activity due to secrecy.

**Impacts of Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities:**

- **Financial impact:** Compromised assets can lead to production/service interruption, correction costs, and potential fines.
- **Identity theft:** Storing sensitive data (PII) carries risks like leaks on the dark web, causing financial and legal issues.
- **Damage to reputation:** Exploited vulnerabilities can lead to customer loss, bad press, and legal penalties.

**Conclusion:**

- Organizations should take proper security measures to mitigate the significant impacts of threats like ransomware attacks.
- Security teams need to be well-equipped to handle such events.
