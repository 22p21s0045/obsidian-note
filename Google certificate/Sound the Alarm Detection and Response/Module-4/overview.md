# Syslog 
is a standard protocol used for logging system messages in a network. It provides a way for devices to send event messages to a logging server (known as a syslog server or syslog daemon). Syslog is commonly used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems, but it is also supported by many other systems, including network devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, and even some Windows servers.
