## What is a virtual machine?

A **virtual machine (VM)** is a virtual version of a physical computer. Virtual machines are one example of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of using software to create virtual representations of various physical machines. The term “virtual” refers to **machines that don’t exist physically**, but operate like they do because their software simulates physical hardware. Virtual systems don’t use dedicated physical hardware. Instead, they use software-defined versions of the physical hardware. This means that a single virtual machine has a virtual CPU, virtual storage, and other virtual hardware. Virtual systems are just code.

>Virtual machines can be managed with a software called a **hypervisor**. Hypervisors help users manage multiple virtual machines and connect the virtual and physical hardware. Hypervisors also help with allocating the shared resources of the physical host machine to one or more virtual machines.
