### Standard FHS directories

Directly below the root directory, you’ll find standard FHS directories. In the diagram, home, bin, and etc are standard FHS directories. Here are a few examples of what standard directories contain:

- /home: Each user in the system gets their own home directory.
    
- /bin: This directory stands for “binary” and contains binary files and other executables. Executables are files that contain a series of commands a computer needs to follow to run programs and perform other functions.
    
- /etc: This directory stores the system’s configuration files.
    
- /tmp: This directory stores many temporary files. The /tmp directory is commonly used by attackers because anyone in the system can modify data in these files.
    
- /mnt: This directory stands for “mount” and stores media, such as USB drives and hard drives.
