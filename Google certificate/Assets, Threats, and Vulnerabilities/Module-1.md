- Assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
- Asset inventories
- Challenges in a rapidly changing digital world

## Security risk planning
- Asset
- Threats
	- Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets
- Vulnerabilities
	- A weakness that can be exploited by a threat



## Levels of asset classification

- Public
	-  is the lowest level of classification. These assets have no negative consequences to the organization if they’re released.
- Internal-only
	- describes assets that are available to employees and business partners.
- Confidential
	- refers to assets whose disclosure may lead to a significant negative impact on an organization.
- Restricted 
	-  the highest level. This category is reserved for incredibly sensitive assets,  like need-to-know information.

## State Of Data

- **Data in Use**: Data in use refers to data that is actively being accessed, processed, or modified by an individual or a corporate application. This data is at its most vulnerable state because it is directly accessible, making it susceptible to attacks or human errors. Encryption is essential for protecting data in use, and additional security measures like authentication and strong passwords are recommended to enhance data security in this state
- **Data in Transit**: Data in transit, also known as data in motion, is data that is actively moving from one location to another, such as across the internet, within a private network, or between devices. This type of data is vulnerable while being transmitted, as it can be intercepted and compromised during the transfer process. Protecting data in transit involves using encryption and secure connections (e.g., HTTPS, SSL, TLS) to safeguard the data while it is moving between networks or devices
- **Data at Rest**: Data at rest refers to inactive data that is not actively moving between devices or networks. This data is typically stored on storage devices like hard drives, laptops, or archives. While data at rest may seem less vulnerable, it is still a target for unauthorized access. Encrypting data at rest is crucial to ensure that even if someone gains access to the storage device, the data remains unintelligible and protected. Best practices for protecting data at rest include using security software, firewalls, encryption, and data loss prevention solutions
