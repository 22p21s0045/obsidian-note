A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or
valuables

- **Phishing:** This involves sending emails or text messages that appear to be from a legitimate source, like your bank or a tech company. The message will often try to scare you into clicking on a malicious link or giving up your personal information.
- **Pretexting:** In this scam, the social engineer will create a fake scenario to gain your trust. For example, they might pretend to be from customer service and say they need your account information to fix a problem.
- **Quid pro quo:** This tactic involves offering something in exchange for your information. For example, the social engineer might offer you a free gift card in exchange for taking a survey that asks for your personal details.
