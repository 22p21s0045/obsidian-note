## Vulnerability management
1. Identify vulnerabilities
2. Consider potential exploits
3. Prepare defenses against threats

## Defense in depth strategy
1. **Perimeter layer**, like authentication systems that validate user access
    
2. **Network layer**, which is made up of technologies like network firewalls and others
    
3. **Endpoint layer**, which describes devices on a network, like laptops, desktops, or servers
    
4. **Application layer**, which involves the software that users interact with
    
5. **Data layer**, which includes any information thatâ€™s stored, in transit, or in use
